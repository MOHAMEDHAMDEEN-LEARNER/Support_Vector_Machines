    "Q1. Best Regression Metric for Predicting House Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "In predicting house prices based on characteristics such as location, square footage, and number of bedrooms, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is typically the best metric. MAE measures the average magnitude of errors without squaring them, which provides an intuitive sense of how close predictions are to actual values. Since MAE reflects errors in the same unit as the target variable, it is useful for understanding the average prediction error in dollar amounts (or other units) when predicting prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning:\n",
    "MAE is more interpretable for real-world applications like house pricing, as it doesn’t overly penalize large deviations, making it suitable when exact prices matter more than minimizing squared errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Choosing Between MSE and R-squared for House Price Prediction Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "If the goal is to predict the house price as accurately as possible, Mean Squared Error (MSE) is generally more appropriate. MSE emphasizes larger errors by squaring them, which encourages the model to reduce these large deviations and improve accuracy. This focus on reducing high errors is crucial when the precise prediction of prices is prioritized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning:\n",
    "In applications where prediction precision matters, minimizing MSE helps ensure the model does not deviate significantly from the actual price, as it penalizes larger prediction errors more than smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Choosing a Regression Metric for Data with Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "For datasets with significant outliers, Median Absolute Error (MedAE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is typically the most appropriate choice. Both metrics are less sensitive to extreme values, making them better suited for datasets where outliers could disproportionately affect performance if a metric like MSE were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning:\n",
    "MedAE, in particular, provides a robust measure that reflects the median of the absolute errors, thus offering a reliable central tendency measure unaffected by outliers. MAE is also less sensitive than MSE and is more interpretable, which is helpful in scenarios with significant variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Choosing Between MSE and RMSE When Values Are Close\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "When both MSE and RMSE values are close, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is often preferred, as it is in the same unit as the target variable (e.g., currency for house prices). RMSE is particularly helpful when interpretability is key, as the error metric directly corresponds to the scale of the predicted variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning:\n",
    "While MSE and RMSE provide similar information, RMSE’s scale equivalency with the target variable (rather than the squared unit as in MSE) makes it easier to understand and communicate the model’s prediction accuracy in practical terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Choosing a Metric to Measure Variance Explanation Across Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "When comparing models with different SVM kernels (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF) to measure how well the model explains variance in the target variable, R-squared is the most appropriate metric. R-squared quantifies the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model, allowing a straightforward comparison of each kernel’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning:\n",
    "R-squared is specifically designed to capture the variance explained by the model, making it ideal for comparing models with different kernels and evaluating which model best captures the underlying pattern in the data.\n",
