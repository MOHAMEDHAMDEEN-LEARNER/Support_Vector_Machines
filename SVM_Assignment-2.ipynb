    "\t1.\tPolynomial and Kernel Functions Relationship:\n",
    "\t•\tPolynomial kernels are a type of kernel function that transform data into a higher-dimensional space using polynomial functions, allowing for complex decision boundaries. Describe how they help create non-linear decision boundaries in SVM and other kernelized models by computing polynomial similarity between data points without explicitly transforming data.\n",
    "\t2.\tImplementing SVM with a Polynomial Kernel in Scikit-Learn:\n",
    "\t•\tUsing Scikit-Learn’s SVC, specify the kernel='poly' parameter to apply a polynomial kernel. Adjust the degree parameter to control the complexity of the polynomial. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.svm import SVC\n",
    "model = SVC(kernel='poly', degree=3, C=1)\n",
    "model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\t3.\tEffect of Increasing Epsilon on Support Vectors in SVR:\n",
    "\t•\tExplain that in Support Vector Regression (SVR), the epsilon parameter defines a margin of error where predictions do not incur any penalty. Increasing epsilon allows more points within this margin, leading to fewer support vectors and a simpler model.\n",
    "\t4.\tEffects of Kernel, C, Epsilon, and Gamma in SVR:\n",
    "\t•\tKernel: Controls the type of decision surface (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF). Use RBF for non-linear patterns and linear for simpler, linear data.\n",
    "\t•\tC: Regularization parameter; lower values increase the margin but allow more misclassifications, while higher values focus on fitting data tightly.\n",
    "\t•\tEpsilon: Defines the margin of tolerance in SVR; higher values allow larger deviations from the true values without penalties.\n",
    "\t•\tGamma: Determines the influence of a single data point; high gamma values create tighter, more complex decision boundaries, while low values yield smoother boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tLibrary Import and Data Loading:\n",
    "\t•\tUse libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and joblib (for saving the model).\n",
    "\t2.\tData Split:\n",
    "\t•\tUse train_test_split to divide the data.\n",
    "\t3.\tData Preprocessing:\n",
    "\t•\tApply scaling/normalization, e.g., using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.\n",
    "\t4.\tTraining an SVC Classifier:\n",
    "\t•\tTrain the SVC classifier with a kernel (e.g., ‘linear’, ‘poly’, or ‘rbf’).\n",
    "\t5.\tEvaluation:\n",
    "\t•\tUse metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. Scikit-Learn’s classification_report can help.\n",
    "\t6.\tHyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "\t•\tUse GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to tune parameters (e.g., C, gamma, degree, etc.) and improve model performance.\n",
    "\t7.\tTrain on Full Dataset and Save the Model:\n",
    "\t•\tTrain the tuned classifier on the entire dataset, then use joblib.dump() to save the model for future use.\n",
